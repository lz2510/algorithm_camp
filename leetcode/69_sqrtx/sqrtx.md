## special case

    if ($x == 0 || $x == 1) {
        return $x;
    }
        
//another way is use below, but if ($x == 0 || $x == 1) is more visulized.

    if($x<2) return $x;
        
## right initial value
//right can be initially as x or x/2. As For xâ‰¥2 the square root is always smaller than x/2 and larger than 0 : 0 < a < x/2.

//if right is x, then follow binary search templte. if right is x/w, then it's more specified for square root.
        
    $right = $x;
    //$right = (int)($x / 2);
        
## return right not left

//return right not left, as the question is return round down the nearest integer, which mean the biggest integer. right is bigger than left.
        
    return $right;
